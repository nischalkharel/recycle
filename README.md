# recycle
We saw that there was a lack of education and incentive for recycling in society. Through our survey, we found that people do wish to recycle, but most of the times, they do not because of the uncertainty of what is or is not recyclable. In class, we were informed that in the case where non-recyclable waste mixes with the recyclable waste, the majority of that will have to end up in landfills, because the non-recyclable waste contaminates the recyclable wastes (expections might exist). So, in order to solve the issue of lack of education regarding recyclable wastes, we create a program that can provide useful information about most common wastes to the users. And, we also received feedbacks that there was no incentive for users to be using our program or even recycling. We came up with scoring system, where neighbors can compete to be on top of the leaderboard by recycling the correct wastes. Our goal is to create a competitive space, because as human, we do want to be better than others.
